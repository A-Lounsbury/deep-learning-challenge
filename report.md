# Overview

# Results
## Data Preprocessing
<!-- What variable(s) are the targets for your model? -->
The `IS_SUCCESSFUL` variable is the target for our model. 
<!-- What variable(s) are the features for your model? -->

<!-- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features? -->
The variables `EIN` and `NAME` should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features. 
## Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model
<!-- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? -->

<!-- Were you able to achieve the target model performance? -->
No, we were only able to achieve a model performance of 73.32% accuracy, which is only about 1.32% better than the original accuracy. 

<!-- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance? -->
